# Homework

* Solution for each task is in its own separate folder, only prerequisite is to have Python installed
* Run solutions from the root folder of the project
* First and second solution can be executed without any setup, for example `python3 first/main.py`
  or `python3 second/main.py`
* The third solution has dependencies, first (once) run `pip install -r third/requirements.txt` and
  then `python3 -m third.main`, note that third solution is reusing bits of first solution (`GNode` and `walk_graph`
  functionality)
